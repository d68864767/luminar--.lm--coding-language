# Language Specification

## Introduction

This document outlines the specification for our new programming language. The language is designed with a focus on readability, consistency, and predictability, making it suitable for both beginners and experienced programmers. It draws inspiration from existing languages, adopting familiar syntax to lower the learning curve.

## Target Audience and Purpose

The language is designed for general-purpose programming, making it versatile for a range of applications from web development to data analysis and system programming.

## Syntax

The syntax of the language is designed to be consistent and predictable. Similar operations look similar, making the language easier to learn and use. The balance between readability and conciseness is maintained, with a slight lean towards readability.

## Data Types and Structures

The language supports primitive data types such as integers, strings, and booleans. It also implements complex data structures like arrays, lists, and dictionaries. For more details, refer to `data_types.py`.

## Control Structures

Control structures include loops (for, while), conditionals (if-else), and function definitions and calls. Modern features like lambda functions and list comprehensions are also included. For more details, refer to `control_structures.py`.

## Error Handling

The language handles errors through exceptions. For more details, refer to `error_handling.py`.

## Operator Overloading and Custom Operators

Operators can be overloaded and custom operators can be defined. 

## Memory Management

The language uses garbage collection for memory management. For more details, refer to `memory_management.py`.

## Typing System

The language uses static typing and implements strong typing. For more details, refer to `typing_system.py`.

## Syntax for Common Paradigms

The language supports object-oriented programming with syntax for classes, objects, inheritance, etc. It also supports functional programming, treating functions as first-class citizens and enforcing immutability. For more details, refer to `syntax.py`.

## Extension Mechanisms

Users can extend the language through plugins and libraries. For more details, refer to `extensions.py`.

## Tooling and Ecosystem

The language is supported by tools like IDEs, debuggers, and linters. For more details, refer to `tooling.py`.

## Documentation and Community Involvement

Comprehensive documentation is provided. Early users are engaged for feedback to refine the syntax. For more details, refer to `documentation.md` and `feedback.md`.

## Testing and Iteration

The language is prototyped with simple programs and iterated based on testing and feedback. For more details, refer to `tests.py`.
