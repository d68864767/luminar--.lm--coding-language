# Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for our new programming language. This document will guide you through the various aspects of the language, from its syntax and data types to its control structures and error handling mechanisms.

## Getting Started

To get started with the language, you will need to have Python installed on your machine. Once you have Python installed, you can download the source code for the language from our repository.

## Language Specification

The language is designed with a focus on readability, consistency, and predictability, making it suitable for both beginners and experienced programmers. It is a general-purpose programming language, making it versatile for a range of applications from web development to data analysis and system programming. For more details, refer to `language_specification.md`.

## Lexer

The lexer is responsible for breaking down the source code into tokens. These tokens are then used by the parser to understand the structure of the code. For more details, refer to `lexer.py`.

## Parser

The parser takes the tokens generated by the lexer and uses them to create an abstract syntax tree (AST). This AST is then used by the interpreter or compiler to execute the code. For more details, refer to `parser.py`.

## Interpreter

The interpreter takes the AST generated by the parser and executes the code directly. It also handles variable assignments and lookups. For more details, refer to `interpreter.py`.

## Compiler

The compiler takes the AST generated by the parser and compiles it into machine code. This machine code can then be executed by the computer. For more details, refer to `compiler.py`.

## Data Types and Structures

The language supports primitive data types such as integers, strings, and booleans. It also implements complex data structures like arrays, lists, and dictionaries. For more details, refer to `data_types.py`.

## Control Structures

Control structures include loops (for, while), conditionals (if-else), and function definitions and calls. Modern features like lambda functions and list comprehensions are also included. For more details, refer to `control_structures.py`.

## Error Handling

The language handles errors through exceptions. For more details, refer to `error_handling.py`.

## Memory Management

The language uses garbage collection for memory management. For more details, refer to `memory_management.py`.

## Typing System

The language uses static typing and implements strong typing. For more details, refer to `typing_system.py`.

## Extension Mechanisms

Users can extend the language through plugins and libraries. For more details, refer to `extensions.py`.

## Tooling and Ecosystem

The language is supported by tools like IDEs, debuggers, and linters. For more details, refer to `tooling.py`.

## Community Involvement

We encourage community involvement in the development and improvement of the language. If you have any suggestions or feedback, please let us know. For more details, refer to `feedback.md`.

## Testing

We have a comprehensive set of tests to ensure the correctness of the language. For more details, refer to `tests.py`.

We hope this documentation helps you in understanding and using our language. Happy coding!
